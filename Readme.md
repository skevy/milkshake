The reason why I decided to fork [Frappé](https://github.com/niftylettuce/frappe) is simple — I'm a React Native developer, and I'm tired of clicking "Reload JS" or "Debug JS" in React Native context menu manually. 
**Milkshake** allows you to shake Android devices (including emulators), and perform some additional actions automatically, for example, start JS debugging and reload JS.

I've also refactored Frappé a bit, and I hope code is more simple and understandable now. Unfortunately, I've removed auto-update feature (but I will probably add it later).
